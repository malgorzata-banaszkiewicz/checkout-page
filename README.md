Project from devChallenges.io with a working checkout page with two products in a basket and a form. You can add more products of the same kind or remove a product from the basket and the price will be corrected. You can also refrain from buying one product altogether. Check out my cool hover effects in the basket and feel free to check the responsiveness of this website. I have put a lot of work into the page's form element, making it fun and interactive. Make sure to check out my custom select element with an animated arrow. You may also be positively surprised by how the checkbox works. Check out the cool hover effect and custom check sign that I have prepared. Compare with a template I have worked with: https://devchallenges.io/challenges/0J1NxxGhOUYVqihwegfO
